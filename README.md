# IFrameUploader
Upload entire folders, such as iframes or websites, to a location on a Azure Storage Blob, or multiple storages, with ease.

## What problem does it solve?
This tool solves the problem of repeatedly going into an azure folder and reuploading the folder content upon every change. With this tool you can make your changes locally, then upload it with the click of a button. It also proves useful if you have to upload the same files over different environments.

To use:
1. Add a connection string to your azure cloud storage
2. Locate the folder you want to upload 
3. Enter the path you want to upload to in the azure storage. 
4. Press upload!

That's all there is to it!
